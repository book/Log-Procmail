        - fixed an =encoding POD directive

        - moved all the documentation at the end of the module and script
        - added a Build.PL script
        - Enrico Sorcinelli (bepi) sent me a log file that
          Log::Procmail couldn't parse correctly. It does now.
        - mailstat.pl works like mailstat(1) when given an empty file
          (except for the shell error message)

0.10 2005-03-28 BOOK
        - added META.yml and made t/01pod.t be seen by CPANTS
        - this is only a kwalitee-raising release, move along, nothing to see

0.09 2005-01-19 BOOK
        - backport to perl 5.005 (Thanks to Mathieu Arnold)
        - can_read() does not work for files on Win32,
          so select() now returns undef on those systems

        - the fh() method returns a filehandle to the currently opened
          log file
        - the select() method returns a IO::Select object watching the
          current fh()
        - example script from Ian Langworth (thanks!)

0.07 2004-04-26 BOOK
        - support From addresses with spaces inside (darn spammers)
        - moved all files to lib/ and scripts, so as to avoid installing
          mailstat.pl in the same directory as Procmail.pm

0.06 2004-04-18 BOOK
        - fully use Test::More for the test suite
        - removed AUTOLOADed methods in Log::Procmail::Abstract
        - Return incomplete log lines when some fields are missing
          or lines are mixed up
        - ymd() returns undef when the date field is not good
        - source() returns the log file name or stringified handle
        - a new test suite to compare mailstat.pl and mailstat

        - changed the sort order in mailstat.pl
        - few cosmetic changes

        - better handling of the mix of tabs and spaces in procmail logs

0.02 2002-02-22 BOOK
        - the Log::Procmail object can now read from filehandles
